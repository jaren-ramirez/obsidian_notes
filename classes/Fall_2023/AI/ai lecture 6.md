## Key Points
1. **[[Monte Carlo Tree Search]]**
   -  1. Selection: Starting at the root of the search we choose a move leading to a successor node, and repeat that process moving down the tree to a leaf
   - 2. Expansion: We grow the search tree by generating a new child of the selected node
   - 3. [[Simulation]]: We perform a playout from the newly generated child node, choosing moves for both players according to playout policy. These moves are not recorded in the search tree
	   - A simulation also called a [[playout]] or rollout chooses moves
   - 4. [[Back-propagation]]: We use the result of the simulation to update all the search tree noes going up to the root
