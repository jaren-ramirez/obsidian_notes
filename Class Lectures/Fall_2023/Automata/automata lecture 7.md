## Key Points
1. **[[Puming Lemma]]**
   - Let L be a regular language
	   - There is an integer p(the pumping length) such taht the following holds:
		   - every string s in L with |s| >= p can be written as s = xyz such that'
			   - $y \neq \epsilon \;\; (i.e |y| \geq 1)$
			   - $|xy| \neq p$
			   - $xy^{i}z \in L\:\;\; for\: all\: i \:\geq 0$
	   - Use pumping Lemma to show that this is not regular
		   - $L= \{0^{n}1^{n}\: | \: n \geq 0\}$
			   - Intuitively if you cant build a dfa for it
		   - Assume that L is regular
			   - let p be the pumping length
			   - choose $s = 0^{p}1^{p}$
