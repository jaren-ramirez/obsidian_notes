# Lecture Notes: [[Computer Networks]]

- [ ] transfer over to atomic notes #urgent #transfer 
## Objectives
- [Main objective 1]
- [Main objective 2]
- [Main objective 3]

## Key Points
1. **Principles of reliable data transfer**
   - Sub-point
   - Sub-point
   - Example or additional information
2. **RDT1.0**
   - Reliable transfer oer a reliable channel
   - underlying channel perfectly reliable
	   - no bit errors
	   - no loss of packers
   - seperate FSMs for sender, reciever
	   - Sender sends data into underlying channel
	   - reciever reads data from underling channel
3. **RDT2.0**
	- underlying channel may flib bits in packet
		- [[checksum]] to detect bit errors
		- the question: how to recover from errors
			- acknowledgements(ACKs)
				- can be corrupted 
					- sender doesnt know what happened at reciever
					- cant just retransmit possible duplicate
			- NAKS
   - Example or additional information
4. **RDT2.1**
   - Sub-point
   - Sub-point
   - Example or additional information
5. **RDT2.2**
	- Sender, reciever fragments
6. **RDT3.0**
	- channels with errors and loss
